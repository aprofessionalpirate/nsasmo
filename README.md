# The Not So Amazing Spider-Man Online
This is an attempt to make the old DOS game 'The Amazing Spider-Man' capable of being played online.

Project was created using Visual Studio 2017. If building, please use the MultiSpideyWinForms project.
The Amazing Spider-Man needs to be launched using DOSBox and must be in game before operating the MultiSpideyWinForms application.

What it essentially does is read the X/Y position of Spider-Man and level title from the memory values of The Amazing Spider-Man and send these to the other connected players.
Right now it is extremely rough around the edges and the network code needs a lot of improvement.
