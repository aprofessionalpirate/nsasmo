	This is a cheat for that old game, The Amazing Spiderman.
 Very useful for ppl, who get stuck in all those numerous rooms...
 I could never figure out how to get out of the Leo's Maze.
 This small loader lets you scroll through the levels, just make sure you
 character is in the right place on the screen.
 It also fixes some of bugs, such as Ctrl-Break screw ups, etc.
 Anyway, here it is, enjoy.

Use +/- on the keypad to move to different levels, use ENTER to update 
the internal counter of levels if the screen didn't change.
Also note: unless you used +/- or ENTER the internal counter is not updated,
although the number displayed in the corner is changed.
So if you moved to another level by just playing the game,
press ENTER before using +/- again.
]/[ keys do the same as +/- on the keypad.
Use '5' on the keypad (press and hold down) to pause the game.
This program also makes the Spiderman invulnerable and bypasses the doc-check.
